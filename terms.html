            Fawoos consulting services and support options typically fall into the following categories. Please review the detailed listed below and <a href="#contact-section-header">follow up</a> to discuss your project and/or support needs.

                    <p>You purchase a pool of consulting hours that may be used for support and related activities. Consulting hours expire after a period of time, and the project and support activities stop when you run out of hours, or when the contract expires.

                    <p>
                        This option works best if you want to do (almost) all the work and need basic Q&A help and guidance for your team and technical staff. Small tasks, questions around a particular feature or use case or the availability of a specific bug fix, best practices or options around configuration profiles, etc all fit within this category.
                    </p>
                    <p><br></p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You can use these hours for any tasks with which you require assistance and guidance. For example, hours can be used for hands-on development and Q/A support, modest feature development, working out bug fixes, coding reviews or pair-programming sessions, collaboration and troubleshooting sessions, answering emails and questions, etc. Since there is <u>no fixed, exact scope</u>, you can direct and change the task list as you wish until there is time left in the project budget.
    
                        <p><br></p>
                        Production rollouts and related support activities are almost always considered out of scope. You are ultimately and independently responsible for production rollouts.
                    </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The typical consulting package offers <strong>20 hours</strong> of support which remain valid for <strong>60 days</strong>. Simply put, the more hours you buy the longer the contract may hold. Unused hours are lost after the contract ends, unless the contract is renewed without delay.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Email exchanges, screen-sharing sessions, and all other Client interactions are collected in <strong>15-minute increments</strong> at a minimum. Furthermore, you will be asked for authorization and approval of time/effort and will be given an estimate for all hands-on and development tasks (i.e. research, bug fixes and feature enhancements, etc.) should your deployment require any.
    
                        <p><br></p>
                        At any time during the project, you may ask for a project budget update and detailed reports to see the hours spent on various tasks. You will also periodically be notified of hours spent and what remains in the project budget.
                    </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Support activities and consulting services are typically done via collaboration sessions, scheduled in advance based on a mutually agreeable time, using tools such as Zoom, MS Teams, etc. This is the only available form of real-time support and assistance. Alternatively Q/A may proceed via email exchanges. The SLA for support requests and exchanges is typically between <strong>1-2 hours CET</strong>.

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>None</strong>. No remote direct access to systems (VPN, Remote Desktop, etc.) will ever be required, used or asked. All interactions are strictly limited to email communications, screen-sharing tools and offline access to redacted configuration files for troubleshooting and testing, etc. if and when necessary.

                    <p>This option requires an exact project description and task list from you. We will discuss your deployment environment, specific support needs, current software versions and all other relevant issues upfront to then arrive at an exact scope, focused on a specific use case. You will then receive a fixed quote. The project stops once the scope is verified and delivered.

                    <p>
                    This option works best if you have a focused, known, sizable task list in mind, such as feature development, software upgrades or specific integrations with third-party applications. It is usually relevant when you prefer to have Fawnoos do all the work for you on your behalf.

                        A fixed-scope project focuses on an exact pre-defined scope written down and reviewed by all stakeholders. Any task that is not strictly defined upfront and noted in the statement of work is considered as out of scope and will be excluded from project delivery.
                        <p><br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h6 style="margin-bottom: 25px;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> When does the project expire?</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The engagement is considered complete once all listed deliverables in the statement of work are submitted and verified. We will discuss the project timeline upfront to determine appropriate start, delivery and verification dates for all produced artifacts.
                    <p><br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h6 style="margin-bottom: 25px;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> How is time calculated?</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Time calculations are not relevant here. You will receive a fixed bid that delivers the predefined scope based on an agreed-upon timeline. You will not be asked to pay more if the project takes longer, and there are no refund options if the project is finished earlier than expected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most likely, we will need direct access to your systems (VPN, Remote Desktop, etc.), source code repositories or deployment environments to complete the work.
