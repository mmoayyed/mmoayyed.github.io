LDAP servers such as OpenLDAP, beyond their fundamental role as directory services, boast robust password policy handling features that are pivotal in fortifying one's organization's cybersecurity defenses. LDAP servers are renowned for their ability to centralize user authentication and authorization across an organization's network and enforce advanced password policy requirements, such as stringent password complexity, the ability to lock user accounts temporarily, etc. 
{% include googlead1.html  %}
In this post, we will take a look at how Apereo CAS may be tuned to allow for advanced password policy handling for LDAP accounts, with a particular focus on Groovy. Our starting position is:

- CAS `7.0.x`
- Java `21`

# LDAP Authentication

To manage password policy enforcement with LDAP, Apereo CAS [must first be configured][ldap] to authenticate user accounts with an LDAP backend, the simplest form of which would be as follows:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
cas.authn.ldap[0].type=DIRECT
cas.authn.ldap[0].dn-format=uid=%s,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
cas.authn.ldap[0].ldap-url=ldaps://ldap.example.org
cas.authn.ldap[0].additional-attributes=*,+
cas.authn.ldap[0].enhance-with-entry-resolver=false
```

This configuration block instructs CAS to look for accounts in the LDAP server that match the specified DN pattern and establish an LDAP `BIND` operation using the supplied user password. Once the bind is successful, CAS will additionally fetch all user and operational attributes attached to the account and will make those available to downstream systems and components for further processing.

Once we have an authenticated account, it's time to evaluate the password policy rules.

# Account Policy Attributes

Let us pretend that our LDAP server has marked the user account as locked with a somewhat non-conventional boolean attribute that is called `accountIsLocked`, which is set to `true`. As our imaginary LDAP server is unable to prevent the user account from successfully authenticating, the expectation falls onto us as the consumer to fetch this attribute, detect its value, and then instruct CAS to block the authentication flow accordingly. This can be done via the following block:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.enabled=true
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.policy-attributes.accountIsLocked=\
  javax.security.auth.login.AccountLockedException
```

The authentication flow will now halt with an `AccountLockedException` signal if the `accountIsLocked` attribute is found to be `true`. The signal is then caught and processed by the webflow layer in CAS to present the appropriate messaging and inform the user appropriately. 

# Groovy Password Policy

A simple *by attribute* type of policy may not be enough in more advanced cases and you may have more sophisticated rules and conditions that need to be calculated on the fly when a decision is made about the authentication flow. One way to handle this type of use case would be with Groovy scripts:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.enabled=true
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.strategy=GROOVY
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.groovy.location=file:/path/to/my/PasswordPolicy.groovy
```

The Groovy script would be something similar to the following:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```groovy
def run(final Object... args) {
    def response = args[0]
    def configuration = args[1]
    def logger = args[2]
    def applicationContext = args[3]
    logger.debug("Handling password policy for [{}]", response)

    // Decide what to do with the LDAP response...
    if (accountIsNotHavingAGoodDay(response)) {
      return [new DefaultMessageDescriptor("lang.account.bad.day")]
    }
    return []
}
```

The above script is mainly tasked to produce a list of warning messages conditionally. Such messages are communicated back to the CAS webflow in the form of language codes that may be found in the CAS language bundled. For example, if the Groovy script decides that *the account is not having a good day*, it will then pass back a warning to CAS that aims to explain this scenario via the CAS user interface under the language code `lang.account.bad.day`. The expectation is that this code is defined in CAS language bundles and is specifically designed to explain this situation:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```properties
lang.account.bad.day=Sorry, you are having a bad day!
```

Remember that the script is producing warnings. Warnings warn and they do not block the flow. Blocking operations would require the script to send a signal to the webflow to halt typically via throwing specific exceptions such as `AccountLockedException`, etc.

# Super Password Policy

As ever, if you are unhappy with Groovy or find that it proves limiting in some cases, you can always do the same sort of thing in Java:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.enabled=true
cas.authn.ldap[0].password-policy.custom-policy-class=org.example.MyPasswordPolicyHandler
```

The `MyPasswordPolicyHandler` component would typically take on the following form:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```java
public class MyPasswordPolicyHandler implements AuthenticationResponseHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(AuthenticationResponse response) {
    }
}
```
