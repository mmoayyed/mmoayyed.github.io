CAS provides a facility for auditing authentication activity, allowing them to be recorded to a variety of storage services. Essentially, audited authentication events attempt to provide the *who, what, when, how*, along with any additional contextual information that might be useful to track activity. Auditable events can be narrowed down and filtered, and may also be stored in a wide range of backend services.

{% include googlead1.html %}

This blog post briefly looks at work with the Audit Log in Apereo CAS. Our starting position is as follows:

- Apereo CAS `6.5.x`
- [CAS Initializr](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.5.x/installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html)

# Audit Log

By default, Apereo CAS uses a file-based auditing mechanism to store auditable events. File-based audit logs appear in a cas_audit.log file defined in the Logging configuration and they may look like this:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
WHO: casuser
WHAT: supplied credentials: ...
ACTION: AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS
APPLICATION: CAS
WHEN: Mon Aug 26 12:35:59 IST 2013
CLIENT IP ADDRESS: 172.16.5.181
SERVER IP ADDRESS: 192.168.200.22
```

Let's review several essential configuration options that should immediately become useful. First, the auditing facility in Apereo CAS is on by default, and may be tweaked using the following setting:

```properties
cas.audit.engine.enabled=false
```
{% include googlead1.html %}
...and if you wanted to tweak the file-based audit log facility,

```properties
cas.audit.slf4j.enabled=false
```

By default, the structure of the audited record shows up in the log in a multi-line format. You could of course opt for a more compact syntax and switch to a single-line format:

```properties
cas.audit.slf4j.use-single-line=true
```
{% include googlead1.html %}
...or you could also switch to JSON:

```properties
cas.audit.engine.audit-format=JSON
```

You may also note that the audit record includes a special field for *Client IP Address*, which typically notes the IP address of the end-user attempting to authenticate, etc. Deployments that are behind a proxy or a load balancer often tend to mask the real IP address by default and expose it using a dedicated header, such as `X-Forwarded-For`. This can be configured with CAS as well, so the correct IP is then recorded into the audit log:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```properties
cas.audit.engine.alternate-client-addr-header-name=X-Forwarded-For
```

A similar trick exists if you are using the embedded Apache Tomcat for the CAS deployment and wish to see the client ip address in the access logs. In this case, the following YAML properties should be effective:

```yaml
server:
  tomcat:
    basedir: /etc/cas/config/logs 
    remote-ip-header: X-Forwarded-For
    accesslog:
      enabled: true
      pattern: "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %l %u %t %r %s %b"
```

# Storage

It's often useful to track audit records in a relational database for future monitoring, data mining, and querying features that may be done outside CAS. Here, we try to configure CAS to push audit data into a PostgreSQL database.

First, ensure you have declared the appropriate module/intention in the build:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation "org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-audit-jdbc"
}
```
{% include googlead1.html  %}
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Remember</strong><br/>You should not have to include additional modules or dependencies to provide database drivers. Those will be automatically provided by CAS to the build with the inclusion of the module above.
</div>

Then, put specific audit settings in your `cas.properties`:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```properties
cas.audit.jdbc.user=postgres
cas.audit.jdbc.password=password
cas.audit.jdbc.driver-class=org.postgresql.Driver
cas.audit.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/audit
cas.audit.jdbc.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL10Dialect
```

Note that the schema for the audit records should automatically be generated by CAS:

```sql
create table COM_AUDIT_TRAIL (
  id int8 generated by default as identity,
  AUD_ACTION varchar(255),
  APPLIC_CD varchar(255),
  AUD_CLIENT_IP varchar(255),
  AUD_DATE timestamp not null,
  AUD_RESOURCE varchar(2048),
  AUD_SERVER_IP varchar(255),
  AUD_USER varchar(255),
  AUD_USERAGENT varchar(255),
  primary key (id)
)
```

# Retrieval

There are two specific actuator endpoints for fetching audited records from the storage: `auditevents` that is provided by Spring Boot, and one is `auditLog` which is owned by CAS. 

First, ensure you have declared the appropriate module/intention in the build:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation "org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-reports"
}
```
{% include googlead1.html %}
...and then let's enable both endpoints:

```properties
management.endpoint.auditLog.enabled=true
management.endpoint.auditevents.enabled=true

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=auditLog,auditevents

cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.auditevents.access=ANONYMOUS
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.auditLog.access=ANONYMOUS
```
{% include googlead1.html %}
Working with actuator endpoints requires a 3-step configuration process:

1. Enable the endpoint
2. Expose the endpoint over HTTP
3. Optionally, define security access rules for each endpoint

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note</strong><br/>To make things easy, I am not enforcing any particular access rules to secure these two endpoints. This should <b>ONLY</b> be done during development and testing. In reality, you should make sure access to such endpoints is protected and secured.
</div>

The two endpoints essentially return the same data though using different HTTP methods and structures. For example, we could begin by invoking the CAS `auditLog` endpoint:

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8443/cas/actuator/auditLog
```

...where the output would be:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```json
[{
  "principal": "casuser",
  "resourceOperatedUpon": "TGT-1-********zVvV7-M-mmoayyed-2656",
  "actionPerformed": "TICKET_GRANTING_TICKET_CREATED",
  "applicationCode": "CAS",
  "whenActionWasPerformed": "...",
  "clientIpAddress": "...",
  "serverIpAddress": "...",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
}]
```

The Spring Boot `auditevents` endpoint is also available using a `GET`:

```bash
curl -k -X GET https://localhost:8443/cas/actuator/auditevents
```

...and that returns similar output:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "principal": "casuser",
      "type": "AUTHENTICATION_EVENT_TRIGGERED",
      "data": { "[UsernamePasswordCredential(username": "casuser, source=null, customFields={})]" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that you can instruct CAS to ignore certain audit activities and actions. For example, if you do not care to see `AUTHENTICATION_EVENT_TRIGGERED` events in your audit log, you could always skip and exclude those:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```properties
# The value here must be a valid regular expression
cas.audit.engine.excluded-actions=AUTHENTICATION_EVENT_TRIGGERED
```
