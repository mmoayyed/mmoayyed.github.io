If you are running CAS in standalone mode without the presence of the Spring Cloud configuration server, you can take advantage of built-in [Jasypt functionality](http://www.jasypt.org/) to decrypt sensitive CAS settings.

Jasypt is a java library which allows the deployer to add basic encryption capabilities to CAS. Jasypt supplies command-line tools useful for performing encryption, decryption, etc. In order to use the tools, you may download the Jasypt distribution. Once unzipped, you will find a `jasypt-$VERSION/bin` directory a number of `bat|sh` scripts that you can use for encryption/decryption operations `(encrypt|decrypt).(bat|sh)`.

{% include googlead1.html  %}

However, an easier approach might be to use the native [CAS command-line shell][shell]. The CAS command-line shell provides the ability to query the CAS server for help on available settings/modules and various other utility functions one of which is the ability to encrypt and/or decrypt settings via Jasypt. We'll use the shell to encrypt a few settings and place them in your CAS configuration file, expecting the server to decrypt and use them as needed.
{% include googlead1.html  %}
Our starting position is based on:

- CAS `7.1.x`
- Java `21`

# Configuration

The [CAS WAR Overlay](https://getcas.apereo.org/ui) presents a few instructions on how to download and run the shell. Once you're in, you can take advantage of the following Jasypt-related commands:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```bash
help encrypt-value
...
help decrypt-value
```
{% include googlead1.html  %}
So let's encrypt a setting:

```bash
cas>encrypt-value value casuser::Misagh alg PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES \
    provider SunJCE password ThisIsMyEncryptionKey iterations 1000

==== Encrypted Value ====
{cas-cipher}mMcg02NysblAcwYI+bFRpEcHBQaVQ51J
```

Nice. Let's verify that it can be decrypted back:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```bash
cas>decrypt-value value {cas-cipher}mMcg02NysblAcwYI+bFRpEcHBQaVQ51J \
    alg PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES provider SunJCE \
    password ThisIsMyEncryptionKey iterations 1000

==== Decrypted Value ====
casuser::Misagh
```

Next, let's use our typical `cas.properties` file with the encrypted value:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```properties
cas.authn.accept.users={cas-cipher}mMcg02NysblAcwYI+bFRpEcHBQaVQ51J
```

Almost there...the last task is to instruct CAS to use the proper algorithm, decryption key, and other relevant parameters when attempting to decrypt settings.

{% include googlead1.html  %}
```properties
# cas.standalone.configuration-security.alg=PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES
# cas.standalone.configuration-security.provider=SunJCE
# cas.standalone.configuration-security.iterations=1000
# cas.standalone.configuration-security.psw=ThisIsMyEncryptionKey
```

The above settings **MUST** be passed to CAS at runtime using either OS environment variables,
system properties or normal command-line arguments. For example, you may run CAS with an embedded servlet container while passing parameters as command-line arguments:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```bash
java -jar -Dlog.console.stacktraces=true \
    build/libs/cas.war \
    --cas.standalone.configuration-security.alg=PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES \
    --cas.standalone.configuration-security.provider=SunJCE \
    --cas.standalone.configuration-security.iterations=1000 \
    --cas.standalone.configuration-security.psw=ThisIsMyEncryptionKey \
    --logging.level.org.apereo.cas=trace
```

# More...

The shell also presents a few more Jasypt-related commands to list out algorithms, providers, etc. If you use the `help` command, you'd be presented with a list of available commands some of which are the following:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```bash
cas>help jasypt-list-algorithms
...
cas>help jasypt-list-providers
...
cas>help jasypt-test-algorithms
...
```

# OpenID Connect Keystore

If your CAS server is running as an OpenID Connect Provider, you might be [tasked][oidc] to securely control and manage the JSON Web Keystore (JWKS) file that is generated by CAS. A typical JWKS would look like the following snippet:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "d": "...",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "use": "sig",
      "n": "...",
      "kty": "RSA",
      "kid": "cas",
      "state": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The contents of the keystore may be encrypted via CAS configuration security just like any other setting. The `encrypt-value` shell command accepts a `file` parameter that should be the path to the JWKS resource for encryption. Once you have the JWKS file encrypted, you may replace its content with the produced encrypted value:
{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
{cas-cipher}pbmmaBoWgFqCoEDY+kiuBKGc0wmovW7bxArWfcQ/...
```

At runtime, CAS will automatically recognize that the file is encrypted and will attempt to decode it back to its original JSON form.


# SAML2 Identity Provider Keys

If your CAS server is running as a SAML2 Identity Provider, you might be [tasked][saml2] to securely control and manage the encryption and signing keys that are produced by the server. Concretely, these would be `idp-signing.key` and `idp-encryption.key` files. A typical private key file would match the following snippet:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAxua2GDhpTMW5UJic04M7P3hXPrKAKXDcoC4Wd3yMEPKUP/ot
ey7Lx/F4n7Td9z6BzBUIjUR0r8X9nta9AfWqI3DGHknFJ7WQVD+nJGzWFjSbtFYh
...
```

Just like before, we can use the `encrypt-value` shell command with a `file` parameter that would point to our `.key` files. Once you have the files encrypted, you may replace their content with the produced encrypted value:

{% include googlead1.html  %}
```
{cas-cipher}ua2GDhpTMW5UJic04M7P3hXPrKAKXD/...
```

At runtime and just like before, CAS will automatically recognize that the file is encrypted and will attempt to decode it back to its original form.

I hope this review was of some help to you and I am sure that both this post as well as the functionality it attempts to explain can be improved in any number of ways.
