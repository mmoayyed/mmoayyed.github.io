The CAPTCHA widgets can protect your Apereo CAS deployment from bots, spam, and other forms of automated abuse. Apereo CAS offers a CAPTCHA integration with support for two implementations: [Google's reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) and [hCAPTCHA](https://www.hcaptcha.com/). 

In this tutorial, we will briefly review the configuration steps required for these two CAPTCHA providers.

{% include googlead1.html %}

Our starting position is as follows:

- CAS `6.4.x`
- Java `11`
- [CAS WAR Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template)

## Google reCAPTCHA

Once the [required extension module](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.4.x/integration/Configuring-Google-reCAPTCHA.html) is included in the [CAS WAR Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), the following settings are required to make the integration work:

```properties
cas.google-recaptcha.site-key=...
cas.google-recaptcha.secret=...

cas.google-recaptcha.verify-url=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify
cas.google-recaptcha.version=GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_V2
cas.google-recaptcha.enabled=true
```

The `site-key` and the `secret` are settings that should be given to you by Google. All other HTML/Javascript changes are automatically handled and provided by CAS. With such settings configured, you should be able to see the following when you next deploy and run CAS:

{% include googlead1.html %}

{% include image.html img="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1205228/107344365-9a0d2e00-6ad7-11eb-914e-da6683d5fc85.png" 
width="80%" title="Apereo CAS with Google reCAPTCHA" %}

Note that the above settings enable Google reCAPTCHA `v2`. Support for [Google reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3) is also available if you were to switch the version to use `GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_V3` instead.

## hCAPTCHA

[hCAPTCHA](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) is a drop-in replacement for Google's reCAPTCHA, and provides simple, easy, and reliable bot detection while being trivial for humans to solve.

Very similar to the previous option, the following settings should do it. As before, `site-key` and the `secret` are settings provided to you by hCAPTCHA.

```properties
cas.google-recaptcha.site-key=...
cas.google-recaptcha.secret=...

cas.google-recaptcha.verify-url=https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify
cas.google-recaptcha.version=HCAPTCHA
cas.google-recaptcha.enabled=true
```

With such settings configured, you should be able to see the following when you next deploy and run CAS:

{% include googlead1.html %}

{% include image.html img="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1205228/107345770-29ffa780-6ad9-11eb-91e2-fa90ec84bde0.png"
