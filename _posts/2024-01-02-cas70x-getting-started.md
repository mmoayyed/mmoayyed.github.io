The process to build and package an Apereo CAS server is typically one that is very much source-oriented and without basic familiarity with Java, web applications, build tools, and servlet containers, it could be quite challenging to get a CAS server up and running quickly. In this post, we will review the list of options that should allow one with a very modest technical background to build and package a CAS server relatively quickly.

{% include googlead1.html %}

This tutorial specifically focuses on:

- CAS `7.0.x`
- Java `21`

# CAS Initializr

[Apereo CAS Initializr](https://getcas.apereo.org/ui) is a component in the Apereo CAS ecosystem that allows you as the deployer to generate CAS WAR Overlay projects on the fly with just what you need to start quickly. Conceptually identical to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io), you can browse the user interface and add/remove modules that you wish to include in your deployment from the menu. At its most basic form, you can in the end either download the project as a `.zip` file manually or do so via the command line:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```bash
mkdir cas-server && cd cas-server
curl "https://getcas.apereo.org/starter.tgz" | tar -xzvf -
```

Then, it's time to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

...and finally, run:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```bash
java -jar build/libs/cas.war --server.ssl.enabled=false --server.port=8080
```

CAS should be running on [`http://localhost:8080/cas`](http://localhost:8080/cas).

# CAS Overlay Template

If you prefer to not deal with the CAS Initializr or in scenarios where it might not be immediately available or under maintenance, there is also a ready-made GitHub repository template for you to clone. This is virtually identical to the project that would be generated by the CAS Initializr for you:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```bash
git clone git@github.com:apereo/cas-overlay-template.git cas-server
cd cas-server

# Build
./gradlew build

# ...and run
java -jar build/libs/cas.war --server.ssl.enabled=false --server.port=8080
```

As before, CAS should be running on [`http://localhost:8080/cas`](http://localhost:8080/cas).

# Docker

The Apereo CAS project does publish Docker images that one can use for showcases and demos. Once you have Docker installed, it should be fairly easy to run the following:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e SERVER_SSL_ENABLED=false -e SERVER_PORT=8080 \
  -p 8080:8080 --name casserver apereo/cas:7.0.0
```

As before, CAS should be running on [`http://localhost:8080/cas`](http://localhost:8080/cas).
