A [while ago](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/forum/#!searchin/cas-user/survey/cas-user/vQr3eBdHNg8/eKm9gkpxIwAJ), the CAS project management commitee prepared a [survey](http://goo.gl/forms/rF9EeCN6GH) to help plan the future roadmap of the project. The primary objectives of the survey were to gain a better understanding of the current configuration pain points from a deployer point of view and learn what additional features and enhancements should have to be prioritized for development.

In this point, I intend to provide a summarized view of the survey results and discuss what has or will be done to address the feedback.
