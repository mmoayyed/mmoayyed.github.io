CAS, being a Spring-Boot application at heart, includes a number of endpoints to help you monitor and manage the server when itâ€™s pushed to production. You can choose to manage and monitor the deployment using HTTP endpoints, referred to as *actuators*. This tutorial provides a basic overview of the `health` and `status` endpoints provided by both Spring Boot and CAS and also provides instructions on how such endpoints can be secured for access and win.

{% include googlead1.html  %}

Our starting position is based on the following:

- CAS `6.1.x`
- Java `11`
- [CLI JSON Processor `jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [CAS WAR Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template)

## Overview

CAS has traditionally presented a `status` endpoint, now at `/actuator/status`, which provides the user with basic server information and reports from all `Monitor` components; those that reported back on memory usage, connection information, etc. Having switched to Spring Boot, such components are transformed to use the native Spring Boot API known as `HealthIndicator`s and the `status` endpoint is mostly kept for legacy reasons and backward compatibility. The `status` endpoint now simply acts as a proxy by invoking the `health` endpoint internally to obtain and present data. If the `health` endpoint is turned off, you would only receive basic and very modest health data from `status` itself.

More information about the health endpoint may be [found here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.1.x/configuration/Configuration-Properties.html#health-endpoint), and high-level notes discussing the monitoring capabilities of the Apereo CAS server can be [found here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.1.x/monitoring/Monitoring-Statistics.html).

## Configuration

Let's try to enable both `status` and `health` first. The following settings should come in handy:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=status,health

management.endpoint.status.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.enabled=true

cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.defaults.access[0]=IP_ADDRESS
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.defaults.requiredIpAddresses[0]=127\\.0\\.0\\.1

management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

The above collection of settings instruct CAS to:

- Expose `status` and `health` over the web as HTTP endpoints.
- Enable them both and ensure access to all endpoints by default is protected by IP addresses that match the given regular expression pattern.
- Ensure the `health` endpoint can always produce details from internal monitors and health indicators.

If you invoke the `status` endpoint using `curl https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/status | jq`:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "description": "OK",
  "health": "UP",
  "host": "misaghmoayyed",
  "server": "https://sso.example.org",
  "version": "6.1.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT - ..."
}
```

Simple stuff. Let's invoke `health` with `curl https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/health | jq`:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "memory": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "freeMemory": 4066209416,
        "totalMemory": 4294967296
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how `details` are *always* returned back in the response where we are getting data from one health indicator, reporting on memory usage and statistics.

## Health Indicators

The `health` endpoint provided by Spring Boot is set to check the status of your running CAS server. It is often used by monitoring software to alert someone when a production system goes down. Health information is collected from the content of a *registry* that has collected, at runtime, reports from `HealthIndicator` components and monitors.  Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured `HealthIndicator`s and CAS presents a few of its own. The final system state is derived by an *aggregator* which sorts the statuses from each `HealthIndicator` based on an ordered list of statuses. The first status in the sorted list is used as the overall health status.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Hey!</strong><br/>If you have monitoring software that tries to check for CAS server status by continuously invoking the <code>/login</code> endpoint, stop doing that. You should be using <code>status</code> or <code>health</code> instead.
</div>

Note that all health indicators (except the `memoryHealthIndicator`) are turned off by default whose capability can be individually controlled. For instance, we could turn off the memory monitor via:

```properties
management.health.memoryHealthIndicator.enabled=false
```

With the above setting, if you try to invoke the `health` endpoint again you may see:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "application": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}
```

...where details on memory usage are now removed, given the monitor underneath is disabled.
