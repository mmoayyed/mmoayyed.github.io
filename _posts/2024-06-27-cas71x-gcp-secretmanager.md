[Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) is a secure and convenient method for storing API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data. Apereo CAS is also able to use Google Cloud Secret Manager to locate properties and settings. In this tutorial, we will briefly look at the configuration options required to connect CAS with Google Cloud Secret Manager.

{% include googlead1.html %}

Our starting position is as follows:

- CAS `7.1.x`
- Java `21`

# Google Application Credentials

You will need to instruct Spring Cloud GCP to connect to Google Cloud. For a deployment that is not running in a GGP environment, this requires that you set up the following environment variable: 

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/gcp.json
```
{% include googlead1.html %}
You can use the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to provide the location of a credential JSON file. This JSON file can be a credential configuration file.

You can provide user credentials by running the `gcloud auth application-default login` command. This command places a JSON file containing the credentials you provide (usually from your own Google Account) in a well-known location on your file system. The location depends on your operating system:

- Linux, macOS: `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json`

# CAS Configuration

Once you have the [right module](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/configuration/Configuration-Server-Management-SpringCloud-GCP-SecretManager.html) in place, you may then instruct your CAS deployment to fetch secrets from Google Cloud Secret Manager and assign them to CAS settings. For example:
{% include googlead1.html %}
```properties
cas.tgc.crypto.encryption.key=${sm://my-encryption-key}
```

Note that the name of the secret can be of your choosing. The above format is the shortest form; we specify secret ID and use the default project and latest version of the secret.
