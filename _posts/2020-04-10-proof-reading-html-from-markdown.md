title:      Validate Generated HTML from Markdown
summary:    HTMLProofer is a set of tests to validate your HTML output. These tests check if your image references are legitimate, if they have alt tags or if your internal links are working, and so on. It's intended to be an all-in-one checker for your output. In this post, you will learn how to validate and verify your HTML documents that are generated from markdown sources.

If you have a set of Markdown documents hosted somewhere (i.e. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) and rendered in HTML format, it would be a good idea to validate and proof-read them all, to make sure image references, links, tags, etc are all working correctly before you publish. Doing so manually would take a lot of time and is quite a tedious task. So in this blog post, we are going to take a look at the [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) tool to see how it can be used to validate our markdown documents. 

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8081398210264173"
     data-ad-slot="3789603713"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

## Requirements

- (Optional) Ruby
- Docker
- Text Editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc)

## How

First, the [documentation](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) instructs us to put together a Ruby script that would mainly depend on the `html-proofer` Ruby gem to process our documents. That script, `html-proofer-docs.rb` would be as follows:

```ruby
require 'html-proofer'
require 'html/pipeline'
require 'find'
require 'fileutils'

# make an out dir
Dir.mkdir("out") unless File.exist?("out")

pipeline = HTML::Pipeline.new [
  HTML::Pipeline::MarkdownFilter,
  HTML::Pipeline::TableOfContentsFilter
], :gfm => true

# iterate over files, and generate HTML from Markdown
Find.find("./docs") do |path|
  if File.extname(path) == ".md"
    contents = File.read(path)
    result = pipeline.call(contents)
    dirname = File.dirname(path)
    FileUtils.mkdir_p ("out/" + dirname)
    content_str = result[:output].to_s
    filename = path.split("/").pop.sub('.md', '.html')
    if filename == "sidebar.html"
      content_str = content_str.gsub! '/%24version' '.'
    end
    File.open("out/#{dirname}/#{filename}", 'w') { |file| file.write(content_str) }
  end
end
# url_ignore - ignore links content not in branch
# file_ignore - ignore CAS spec b/c it has lots of bad anchor links, only *.html files are processed
options = {
            :file_ignore =>  [ %r{.*/CAS-Protocol-Specification.html} ],
            :disable_external => true,
            :only_4xx => true,
            :empty_alt_ignore => true,
            :url_ignore => [ %r{^/cas}, %r{^../images/}, %r{^../../developer/} ],
          }
# test your out dir!
HTMLProofer.check_directory("./out", options).run
```

Then, all that is left is to run the script. If you have Ruby installed, you should be able to execute the script directly. Alternatively, I am going to use a Docker image that my colleague, [Hal Deadman](https://github.com/hdeadman) on the [Apereo CAS project](https://github.com/apereo/cas), put together to run the script all via a `proof.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
clear
docker run --name="html-proofer" --rm --workdir /root \
    -v $(pwd)/_posts:/root/docs \
    -v $(pwd)/out:/root/out \
    -v $(pwd)/html-proofer-docs.rb:/root/html-proofer-docs.rb \
    --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/ruby \
    hdeadman/html-proofer:latest /root/html-proofer-docs.rb
# rm -Rf ./out
```

The script above assumes that Markdown documents are found in the current directory inside a `_posts` folder which is then mapped onto the running container. HTML files will be generated in an `out` directory and of course, the location of the Ruby script is assumed to also be in the same directory. 

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8081398210264173"
     data-ad-slot="3789603713"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

If you run the script, hopefully you will see the following output:

```
Running ["ImageCheck", "ScriptCheck", "LinkCheck"] on ["./out"] on *.html...
Ran on 123 files!
HTML-Proofer finished successfully.
```

Or, you might see errors:

```
  *  (https://pages.github.com/) is an invalid URL (line 8)
     <a href="(https://pages.github.com/)">GitHub Pages</a>
```

If your Markdown documents are technical documentation and manuals, let's say for a project that is hosted on GitHub, you could very easily integrate the above steps into [your CI workflow](https://travis-ci.org/apereo/cas/builds) and automate the validation process for all commits and pull requests. 

## Finale

I hope this review was of some help to you. Be sure to take a look at [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) and give it a try. Of course, kudos to [Hal Deadman](https://github.com/hdeadman) for putting together the script, the Docker image and the follow-up work that went into the [Apereo CAS project](https://github.com/apereo/cas) to make sure the documentation syntax is kept up to par.
