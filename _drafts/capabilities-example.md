summary:    Sample of the Pixyll styles

All links are easy to [locate and discern](https://www.google.com){:target="_blank"}, yet don't detract from the harmony
of a paragraph. The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Here's an example of some code with line anchors.

{% highlight XML lineanchors %}
  <dependency>
    <groupId>net.unicon.cas</groupId>
    <artifactId>cas-addon-hazelcast-ticket-registry</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0-GA</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java lineanchors %}
  public class Person {
    private String name;

    public String greet(String otherPerson) {
      return "Hello world";
    }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.foobar {
  /* Named colors rule */
  color: tomato;
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

### There's more being added all the time
