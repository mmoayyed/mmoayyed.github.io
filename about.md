I am a software engineer and consultant at [Unicon Inc](https://www.unicon.net)
and a member of [Identity and Access Management group](https://www.unicon.net/solutions/identity-and-access-management).

You can find my full professional bio [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmoayyed).
I also blog [here](https://www.unicon.net/about/blogs/blogger/15) sometimes.

I am an avid traveler who enjoys reading, movies, swimming, tennis, gardening, exotic food, playing guitar/piano/dulcimer
and wrecking code I don't fully understand. While I am originally from Iran, occasionally I pretend to be fluent
in English, German and Arabic. With the exception of Baseball, Golf and American Football, I am a sports fan and dearly support Germany's
national soccer team and that of Bayern Munich.

My travel plans, whereabouts and charming looks are among the favorite topics of discussion between the IAM team members.

All opinions, views and controllers expressed in this blog are my own.
