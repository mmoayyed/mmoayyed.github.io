I am a software engineer at [Unicon Inc](https://www.unicon.net) 
and a member of [Identity and Access Management group]((https://www.unicon.net/solutions/identity-and-access-management).

You can find my full professional bio [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmoayyed).

I am a fan of Germany's national soccer team and that of Bayern Munich, used to support the Boston Celtics Basketball team dearly.
I am an avid traveler who enjoys reading, movies, swimming, gardening, exotic food, playing guitar/piano/dulcimer and wrecking code I don't fully understand. 

My travel plans, whereabouts and charming looks are among the favorite topics of discussion between the IAM team members.

All opinions, views and controllers expressed in this blog are my own.
