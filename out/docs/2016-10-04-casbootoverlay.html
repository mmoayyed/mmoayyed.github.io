<p>As you may know, the recommended strategy to start a CAS deployment today is via the<br>
<a href="https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Maven-Overlay-Installation.html">WAR Overlay Installation Method</a>. The idea is that a deployment gets to keep only local customizations<br>
and <em>inherits</em> everything else from a pre-built pre-configured instance. Not only this allows<br>
one to keep track of intentional changes, but also makes it easier to upgrade<br>
the software in place by simply bumping the CAS version in the overlay script.</p>
<p>CAS 5 itself is entirely based on Spring Boot. Today, CAS 5 overlays for both <a href="https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template/tree/5.0">Maven</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apereo/cas-gradle-overlay-template/tree/5.0">Gradle</a> too are modified to accommodate easier deployment options via Spring Boot.</p>
<p>Here's how.</p>

<p>Today, adopters are given 3 choices to deploy an overlay:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the CAS web application as an executable WAR via a <code>java -jar &lt;cas-war-file&gt;</code> type of command.</li>
<li>Deploy the <code>&lt;cas-war-file&gt;</code> into an external container of choice, such as Apache Tomcat.</li>
<li>[<strong>NEW</strong>] Run the CAS web application as an executable WAR via the Spring Boot's Maven/Gradle plugin, though you may be interested in <a href="https://github.com/apereo/cas/issues/2334">this issue</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd option is similar to the native <code>java -jar ...</code> command with the main difference that the Spring Boot plugin is able to recognize the presence of Spring Boot's <code>devtools</code> that is shipped with CAS by default and allows for ad-hoc live monitoring of CAS resources.</p>
<p>This is specially helpful perhaps during UI design; such that you could keep modifying<br>
<code>html</code>, <code>css</code>, and <code>js</code> resources and CAS will auto-detect changes and allows you to<br>
see them via a simple refresh of your browser.</p>
<p>Lots quicker!</p>
