title:      Apereo CAS - Have you been pawned?<br>
summary:    Learn how Apereo CAS may be configured to check for pawned passwords and warn the user, using the haveibeenpawned.com service<br>
tags:       [CAS]</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I been pwned</a> is an online service that tracks security breaches and other datalogs on the internet,<br>
allowing you to check if your passwords linked to an email have been compromised. This is a very simple method and does not guarantee that your stuff is safe,<br>
or will continue to be safe. It does, however, allow you to have an idea of when data linked to your accounts might have been exposed,<br>
and whether you changed (or not) your passwords since that point.</p>
<p>A CAS deployment, as an entity that can support username/password credentials, can be integrated with this service such that after the user logs<br>
in with a valid password, CAS may check it against the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange">service API</a> and present a page to the user notifying them if their password has been pwned suggesting they should change it, but allow them to continue.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is fairly simple to do in CAS and while there are a variety of ways to tap into the authentication flow, in this post we shall take advantage of<br>
the CAS authenticator post-processors supported by a Groovy script. Our starting position is based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAS <code>6.1.x</code>
</li>
<li>Java <code>11</code>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template">CAS WAR Overlay</a></li>
</ul>

<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>
<p>First, we are going to teach CAS about the Groovy script that is to contact the relevant APIs and check for a pawned password:</p>
<pre lang="properties"><code>cas.authn.engine.groovyPostProcessor.location=file:/etc/cas/config/GroovyPostProcessor.groovy
</code></pre>
<p>Our script itself may look like this:</p>
<pre lang="groovy"><code>import org.apereo.cas.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.credential.*
import java.net.*

def run(Object[] args) {
    def builder = args[0]
    def transaction = args[1]
    def logger = args[2]

    def credential = transaction.getPrimaryCredential().get()
    def password = credential.password
    def passwordSha1 = password.digest('SHA-1').toUpperCase()
    
    /*
        Contact the API using the SHA-1 digest of the credential password.
        Parse through the results, check for matches and produce a warning 
        where appropriate.
     */

    if (passwordHasBeenPawned()) {
        builder.addWarning(new DefaultMessageDescriptor("password.pawned"))  
    }
}

def supports(Object[] args) {
    def credential = args[0]
    def logger = args[1]
    credential instanceof UsernamePasswordCredential
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, the CAS message/language bundle (typically <code>custom_messages.properties</code> file) should also contain the text for the warning code <code>password.pawned</code>:</p>
<pre lang="properties"><code>password.pawned=Your password is commonly used. Go &lt;a href="https://example.org"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to change it.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the script itself is automatically monitored and cached for changes, so feel free to tweak and update as often as needed to test<br>
your changes without restarting the CAS server environment.</p>
